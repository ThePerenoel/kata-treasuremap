# Treasure Map Kata

The aim of this kata is to create a map made of obstacles (mountains) and
treasures that an adventurer will be able to pick up as he walks over the
corresponding case.

To do so, the exercise will be divided into different user stories.

## User story 1 : create a map

In this US, I want to have a map composed of 4 rows and 3 columns when I input
"C-3-4"

## User story 2 : Add obstacles

I want to have a map composed of 4 rows, 3 columns and a mountain in position 1
- 1 when I input
"C-3-4
M-1-1"
